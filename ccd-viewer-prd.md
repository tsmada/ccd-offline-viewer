# CCD Viewer - Product Requirements Document
*A modern, HIPAA-compliant Continuity of Care Document viewer inspired by jwt.io's clarity and Winamp's nostalgic power*

## Executive Summary

### Vision
Create the definitive CCD/CDA document viewer that combines the analytical clarity of jwt.io with the nostalgic, power-user interface of Winamp. A tool that healthcare professionals actually *want* to use - both as a public web service for non-sensitive data and as a downloadable, air-gapped desktop application for HIPAA-protected information.

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 100,000+ monthly active users within 6 months
- **Performance**: < 500ms document parsing for 95% of CCDs
- **Security**: Zero HIPAA violations, 100% local processing option
- **Satisfaction**: NPS > 50 from healthcare professionals
